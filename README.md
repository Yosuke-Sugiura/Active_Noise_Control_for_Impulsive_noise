# FxlogLMS+: Modified FxlogLMS Algorithm for Active Impulsive Noise Control

This repository contains MATLAB code implementing FxlogLMS+, a modified FxlogLMS algorithm for active control of impulsive noise.

The aim of this algorithm is to achieve robust and fast convergence in environments affected by **impulsive noise**, which often causes performance degradation in conventional ANC systems.
